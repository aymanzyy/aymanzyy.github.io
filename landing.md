					<h3>Heirloom Coffee Shop</h3>
				</header>
				<p>* Located in Raleigh, NC
  * What I ordered: Brown Sugar Five Spice Latte
  * Great atmosphere and design
  * Barista recommended drink (touted as having a more complex taste compared to your average cinnamon-y lattes)  that was pretty nice to sip on slowly. Should’ve     got more ice on it and didn’t always get the five spices but overall a really nice different kind of drink. 
  * 8/10 .</p>

					<h3>Percantile & Creamery</h3>
				</header>
				<p>* Located in Charlotte, NC
  * What I ordered: White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha
  * Cute interior and warm atmosphere
  * Hands down the best drink I’ve hand since I came to North Carolina. Thought that I wouldn’t like it at first because of a strong first gust of raspberry, but the white chocolate came back in the second half and played off the sour bits the raspberry brought. 
  *  10/10</p>

					<h3>The Oak House at Durham</h3>
				</header>
				<p>* Located in Durham, NC
				  * What I ordered: Pumpkin Spice Latte
				  * Modern look and makes you feel sophisticated
				  * Wasn’t getting a strong taste of pumpkin like I expected, more cinnamon than anything else. Location was really nice and cozy in Downtown Durham, which makes it the perfect fall/winter study spot. 
				  * 7/10.</p>

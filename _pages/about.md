This is a site that you can use to get to know me and some of my interests. I am currently a PhD student at Duke University, studying computational fluid dynamics.
Welcome! I am currently a PhD student at Duke University studying computational fluid dynamics. I earned my a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering at [Univeristy *of* Arkansas *at* Fayetteville](https://www.uark.edu).

If you have any questions for me, you can contact me via email or through my LinkedIn page. Any & all coffee spot suggestions are much appreciated.

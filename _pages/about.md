This is a site that you can use to get to know me and some of my interests. I am currently a PhD student at Duke University, studying computational fluid dynamics.
Welcome! I am currently a PhD student at Duke University studying computational fluid dynamics. I earned my a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering at [Univeristy *of* Arkansas *at* Fayetteville](https://www.uark.edu).

I am currently interested in Machine Learning and Computational Fluid Dynamics, exploring different methods/algorithms to help supercede the computational costs that come with simulations. Previous projects can be found in my GitHub repo. Extracurriculars include playing basketball, hiking, cooking/baking, and reviewing coffee spots in search for the best mocha on Earth (& hopefully Mars if Elon gets on it).

If you have any questions for me, you can contact me via email or through my LinkedIn page. Any & all NC or RTP coffee spot suggestions are much appreciated.

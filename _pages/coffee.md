Starbucks Roastery (9/10)
=====
* Located in Chicago, Illinios
  * What I ordered: Dark Chocalate Mocha, Hazelnut Bianco Latte, Cannolis
  * Staff is very busy so not much interaction.
  * Seating is basically nonexistent due to the popularity of the place. If you can find it, the views are great 
  * Both drinks were exceptional, albeit fairly costly considering the size. The cannoli was quite possibly the best dessert I've had in the last 5 years
  * ![]()

Foxtrot (7/10)
=====
* Located in Chicago, Illinios
  * What I ordered: Iced Mocha, Breakfast Taco
  * Staff was very friendly, giving me a rundown of the bodega. 
  * Seating was easily available and gave off a more casual vibe
  * Both the drink and taco were standard, nothing to write home about 
  * 
  * ![]()
  
La Colombe (8/10)
=====
* Located in Chicago, Illinios
  * What I ordered: Nitro Cold Brew
  * Staff weren't the nicest but I'm chalking it up to the Chicago rain. 
  * One of the most unique shops I've been to, as the total square footage of the spot is less than some living rooms I've been in
  * Seating was difficult and there isn't much standing room. 
  * The drink was pretty nice, an upgrade over the nitro cold brews that Starbucks offer
  * ![]()
    
Hex Coffee (10/10)
=====
* Located in Charlotte, North Carolina
  * What I ordered: Iced Fruity Pebbles Latte
  * Staff were fantastic, running me through their menu and the backstory behind the funky looking shop
  * Seating wasn't available as the shop is fairly small. 
  * This was the best iced coffee I'd ever had. The latte was made with fruity pebbles infused milk and a side of fruity pebbles was given to me on the side to add the coffee as I drank. Innovative and worth the drive to Charlotte. 
  * ![]()
 
Cocoa Cinnamon (7/10)
=====
* Located in Durham, North Carolina
  * What I ordered: Iced Mocha
  * Staff were standard
  * Seating easy to lockdown due to the obscure location of the shop
  * Nothing much to say here, fairly standard mocha
  * ![]()

Jetplane Coffee (6/10)
=====
* Located in Durham, North Carolina
  * What I ordered: Iced Mocha
  * Ehh
  * ![]()

Mylo's Coffee (8/10)
=====
* Located in Little Rock Arkansas
  * What I ordered: April Showers Iced Latte
  * Staff is fairly serious but nice enough. Very cordial when it comes to serving customers
  * Seating isn't readily available but comes with a great view. Might be the coziest place I've ever been to. 
  * Drink was sweet and light, making the most of the raspberry syrup without having it take over.
  * ![](/images/IMG_2397.jpg)


Iris Coffee Lab (8/10)
=====
* Located in Raleigh, NC
  * What I ordered: Iced Cherry Marzipan Latte
  * The staff is the best I've ever come across. Everyone who works here is the bomb
  * Seating is readily available and the art feels very modern and welcoming. Arthouse vibe.
  * Drink was sweet, nutty, and most definitely the most unique coffee I've ever had. Bit small is all
  * ![](/images/IMG_2247.jpg)


Perennial Cafe (6.5/10)
=====
* Located in Chapel Hill, NC
  * What I ordered: Iced Mocha
  * Comforting due in large part to how small it is, Perennial is your classic downtown coffee shop
  * Not much seating and the drinks were a lot smaller than expected, even though price as about average
  * Drink wasn't very sweet but the coffee itself really shone because of this
  * ![](/images/perennial.jpg)




Fount Coffee + Kitchen (8/10)
=====
* Located in Morrisville, NC
  * What I ordered: Salted Caramel Latte
  * Design was one of the best I've seen in a coffee shop, with a 3-storied bench as the waiting area for to-go orders to boot
  * Limited seating, but possibly do largely in part to snow day before causing more people to go out
  * Drink was bit too sweet but the actual espresso underneath was very smooth 
  * ![](/images/IMG_2217.jpg)
  * ![](/images/IMG_2215.jpg)



42 & Lawrence (7/10)
======
* Located in Raleigh, NC
  * What I ordered: Peppermint Mocha
  * Very cool looking bar, but limited seating/space
  * Very sweet drink and good hints of peppermint, but had a burnt coffee smell that through me off throughout. 
  * ![](/images/IMG_2205.jpeg)

Heirloom Brewshop (8/10)
======
* Located in Raleigh, NC
  * What I ordered: Brown Sugar Five Spice Latte
  * Great atmosphere and design
  * Barista recommended drink (touted as having a more complex taste compared to your average cinnamon-y lattes)  that was pretty nice to sip on slowly. Should’ve     got more ice on it and didn’t always get the five spices but overall a really nice different kind of drink.

The Percantile & Creamery
======
* Located in Charlotte, NC
  * What I ordered: White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha
  * Cute interior and warm atmosphere
  * Hands down the best drink I’ve hand since I came to North Carolina. Thought that I wouldn’t like it at first because of a strong first gust of raspberry, but the white chocolate came back in the second half and played off the sour bits the raspberry brought. 
  *  10/10
  *  ![](/images/perc.jpg)

The Oak House (8/10)
======
* Located in Durham, NC
  * What I ordered: Pumpkin Spice Latte
  * Modern look and makes you feel sophisticated
  * Wasn’t getting a strong taste of pumpkin like I expected, more cinnamon than anything else. Location was really nice and cozy in Downtown Durham, which makes it the perfect fall/winter study spot.

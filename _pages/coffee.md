======
* Located in Raleigh, NC
  * What I ordered: Brown Sugar Five Spice Latte
  * Great atmosphere and design
  * Barista recommended drink (touted as having a more complex taste compared to your average cinnamon-y lattes)  that was pretty nice to sip on slowly. Should’ve     got more ice on it and didn’t always get the five spices but overall a really nice different kind of drink. 
  * 8/10

The Percantile & Creamery
======
* Located in Charlotte, NC
  * What I ordered: White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha
  * Cute interior and warm atmosphere
  * Hands down the best drink I’ve hand since I came to North Carolina. Thought that I wouldn’t like it at first because of a strong first gust of raspberry, but the white chocolate came back in the second half and played off the sour bits the raspberry brought. 
  *  10/10

The Oak House
======
* Located in Durham, NC
  * What I ordered: Pumpkin Spice Latte
  * Modern look and makes you feel sophisticated
  * Wasn’t getting a strong taste of pumpkin like I expected, more cinnamon than anything else. Location was really nice and cozy in Downtown Durham, which makes it the perfect fall/winter study spot. 
  * 7/10

42 & Lawrence 
======
* Located in Raleigh, NC
  * What I ordered: Peppermint Mocha
  * Very cool looking bar, but limited seating/space
  * Very sweet drink and good hints of peppermint, but had a burnt coffee smell that through me off throughout. 
  * 7/10

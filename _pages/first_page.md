Welcome! My name is Ayman and I am currently a PhD student at Duke University. I work in the Randles Lab, a Biomedical Engineering lab focusd on utilizing computational fluid dynamics to advance human health. I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering at [Univeristy *of* Arkansas *at* Fayetteville](https://www.uark.edu).

I am currently interested in machine learning and computational fluid dynamics, exploring different methods/algorithms to help supercede the computational costs that come with simulations. Previous projects can be found in my GitHub repo. Extracurriculars include playing basketball, hiking, cooking/baking, and reviewing coffee spots in search for the best mocha on Earth (this might take me a while so cut me some slack).

If you have any questions for me, you can contact me via email or through my LinkedIn page. Any & all NC or RTP coffee spot suggestions are much appreciated.
